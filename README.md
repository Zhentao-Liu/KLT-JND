# KLT-JND
This is a brief introduction of our proposed JND profile with totally new design philosophy based on KLT.

# Just Noticeable Distortion
The invisibility of human visual system (HVS) has been firstly studied by cognitive scientists during the past decades. Just noticeable distortion (JND) map in an image reveals the invisibility of HVS. There is a redundance of visual content in that image. HVS would not perceive difference if we remove that part of redundant visual content from original image. And that redundant visual content is termed as the JND map. Due to JND map describe the invisibility of HVS, the JND approaches are often used for image/video coding and transmission, visual image/video enhancement, information hiding, visual quality assessment, watermarking, and so on. Nowadays, JND profile estimation has emerged as an active research topic with great importance for both academia and industry realms.
